# Heading test

First, we need an application that will generate logs. We will use a slightly modified version of a Java Spring [webpage example repo](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-serving-web-content). Let's clone this modified version:

`git clone https://github.com/andreaskth/gs-serving-web-content.git`{{execute}}

This modified version extends the original one by adding a few endpoints that will spawn some logging for us to use with ELK.

And some text.
